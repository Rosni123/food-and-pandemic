         <h3>FOOD AND PANDEMIC</h3>
         <p>As the COVID‐19 pandemic of 2020 unfolds, considerable attention has focused on the resiliency of food supply chains in a time of crisis. Food supply chains have needed to adjust rapidly to demand‐side shocks, including panic buying and changes in food purchasing patterns, as well as plan for any supply‐side disruptions due to potential labor shortages and disruptions to transportation and supply networks. The challenges are facing in food supply chains worldwide during the current crisis and our team will try to offers thoughts on policy and industry strategies to enhance food supply chain resilience. So far, we have food on our plate but are we still unaware of the journey it travelled during this pandemic? Today our planet is running a fever of covid-19. We can’t imagine life without farmers providing us with one of the basic necessities of life i.e. , food who today are still in the fields, often without sick pay or health insurance, planting and harvesting nation’s food supply. In any scenario, the most affected will be the poorest and the most vulnerable segments of the population depended of agriculture. </p>

<p class=para> <span class="span">O</span>ur food supply is based on demand and supply chain. Nobody could have predicted the downfall beforehand and it made a huge difference in this supply-demand equilibrium chain. At present scenario, the supply is as usual but the demand is drastically low due to the effect of lockdown. One can wonder why demand is drastically low since it’s too predictable. All the restaurants, hotels where food items that require highest intensive labor agriculture are closed as a result of pandemic outbreak. The problem this sudden shift creates is not only for farmers but everybody. The vegetables, fruits are getting cheaper than ever because the production rate is same and consumers rate is drastically decreased. Similarly, tons of food items like butter, cheese, varieties of sauces used in restaurants all are imported from India and people aren’t buying it. It’s just decaying out in departmental stores. According to Nepal Dairy Association (NDA), dairy producers have faced losses worth Rs 2 billion on milk alone. Dairy producers must collect milk from farmers. But there is no demand in the market. If their products aren’t sold, they can’t afford to pay farmers and farmers will not survive long enough without payment. The problem is universal. Only 30% of total production across the country is being consumed at the moment. 70% of food production is on wastage. We’re just in a first phase as foods in the market are decaying and substandard people can’t even afford to pay it. Famine will soon strike them hard. Production rate will fall and supply will be
   reduced when farmers don’t get enough pay. In the second phase after some certain
   period not only substandard people, everyone will be bound to suffer from famine
   due to downfall of supply rate. Famine will be common problem but not the least
    infection of virus and immunity against it is on other hand as the rate is
     increasing exponentially.<p>

       <br>

       <br>
       <br>
<p>1.	The system of Lockdown has complicated the flow of food system incorporating
 different stage of food production from the farm to fork  (e.g., processing,
  distribution and preparation activities, consumption, and finally discharge) and
   various involved parts (e.g., infrastructure, agricultural inputs, landscape, farmers, retailers, shipping, and institutions).</p>
<br>
<br>
2.	Maintaining the Food system play an important role in ending hunger. So Food system can be maintained by ending the global food waste at the retail and consumer level. This will lead to improved nutrition for all and correct distribution of food to the charity, poverty, by the NGOs.
<br>
<br>
3.The current food system is highly dependent to meat-based food which is not at all beneficial in environmental point of view. It is because of this meat-based food that the unseeable microbes takes it’s leap from animal’s body to human being and cause serious disease.
<br>
<br>
4.	The missing links in food supply chain has created a lot of devastation and disruption in various fields
a.	Harvesting: As spring has arrived, the crops are rotting in the field. Due to the border restrictions, workers are simply afraid of infections. For instance, Europe’s asparagus growers are having shortage of staffs.
b.	Logistics: Food transports are being extremely complicated due to border controls and expensive restrictions of fresh goods.
c.	Processing: The food processing plants are having their outputs awfully scrambled due to shutting down of suppliers. In Canada, for example, poultry farmers collectively acted to reduce their output by 12.6%
d.	Markets and Sourcing: Companies like soft drink producers are having sales slashed due to lockdown measures. Supermarkets have their most items

<h1 class="h1">WHAT TO DO??</h1>
<br>
<br>

<p>1.	Nutrition plays a crucial role in our health, particularly in such time where immune system should be made stronger.  Due to limited goods in our confined surrounding, ONE MUST COMPROMISE OPPURNITIES TO CONTINUE EATING. SO EATING VER LESS AND SUFFICIENT AMOUNT SHOULD BE OUR PRIORITY.
Overeating will make a person fatter and be in demand of more oxygen. SO Researchers say more fat will make you less fit.
<br>
<br>


2.	For a good health, IT IS IMPORTANT TO STAY PHYSICALLY ACTIVE
<br>
<br>
3.WHILE AT HOME and staying hydrated at all times.
<br>
<br>

4.Foods rich in Vitamins should be consumed as it can boost immune system. For instance, Vitamin C plays a protective role in supporting the immune system by developing the body tissues and under certain conditions, it restricts the susceptibility of upper respiratory tract to infection. Foods rich in Vitamin C are broccoli, cauliflower, kiwi, citrus fruits. Other  vegetables like Carrots, Spinach and sweet potatoes contain Vitamin A. Vitamin A play an important immune function to lower the susceptibility of infection. For instance, Isotretinoin(a derivative of Vitamin A) mediates the down regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme( ACE-2)which is a crucial host cellular protein required for the entry of SARS-nCOV 2 in the body
<br>
<br>
4.The Laws on Social distancing and washing hands should not be broken. All vegetables brought to home should be thoroughly washed.

What about the Food supply chains and food security?
<br>
<br>
 This COVID-19 pandemic made the world completely unaware and more vulnerable to our agricultural and food security systems as well.

<h1 class="h1"> Sustainable Goals</h1>
<h3>1.Prioritization of Basic Needs</h3>
    The wastage of production means the foods are not prioritized as per basic needs of people. When producers produce only the necessary nutritious food to sustain the population, cutting off extra demands that we had before (like halting to produce anything except balanced diet) we’ll have the ability to manage the best from what we have. Resource management is vital in eradicating the unbalanced food chain supply caused by pandemic outbreak.


<br>
<br>

<h3>2.Technological Maneuver in sustainable food supply chain management</h3>
Government and other private organization should focus in technological maneuver over traditional food chain supply. Government can create the proper environment for startups and private company to invest over traditional farming. When the technological innovations are applied in food-chain supply will not disrupt immediately. And, farmers should be used only for growing intensive labor crops. Farmers are key to food chain supply. So, keeping them immune also should be our top priority. For this proper guidelines and practices for safe social distancing should be taught and put into action.
<br>
<br>

<h3>3.Packaging and containment for sustainability</h3>
The major problem right now is wastage of food which is happening when foods are kept openly. Packaged foods are always certified to last longer than foods exposed freely. So, by packaging the foods and keeping them in proper containment we can eradicate wastage of tons of foods from the market. According to research from FAO, the virus can survive on a variety of surfaces such as plastic or cardboard used in packaging, but it is unlikely that this type of exposure would be sufficient to make a person sick. Similarly, foods will indirectly be free from viruses when it’s not exposed.
<br>
<br>
<h3>4.Good Hygiene Habits and Awareness</h3>
<br>
.Food businesses and their operators must reinforce good hygienic practices and standard operating procedures. Strict personnel hygiene is crucial.The best way to avoid COVID-19 is through good hygiene habits. We’re to wash our hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and dry thoroughly with a clean towel - after shopping, before handling food and during preparation.Similarly,social distancing is key.All equipment and surfaces used for food preparation should be washed and sanitized before it is distibuted in the market.






<br>
<br>
<br>

  <h3>5.Proper utilization</h3>
  <br>
  <p class="para">	The rotting of the stockpiled food could be used instead of dumping. They could be beneficial for the use of fermentation. It is easy enough to ferment rotten fruits, vegetables to create somethingelse by the use of microbes present in them. Alcohol, Kambucha, Kimchi, Gundruk and so on are results
  of all those food which we consume almost everyday.
	We can imply traditional practices like planting possible vegetables at home as Home gardening where Biodegradable can act as compost with biosolids(stools) as fertilizers
	Food should never be wasted. Efforts like adding sizable amount for food supply chain should be taken so as to shop Postharvest losses. Infact consuming of limiting amount of food can be helpful because there are many people who suffer from starvation.

  .	Agrobusiness leader must invest on building digitally connected supply chains so as to rapidly adjust the global need in this pandemic. The supply chains should be operating so there is an ensured globally connected population to meet dietary and nutritional needs.
